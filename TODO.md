# Problems
Using stylus built-in compression as CleanCSS and CSSNano won't work with postStylus on the CLI (async). Options are to  move to JS, or find a way to compress during Stylus' watch command.
Tried:
  postbuild:css script failed as it doesn't fire after each watched stylus change - technically build:cssnever finishes when watching
  Not using Stylus' watching, but instead using nodemon to detect stylus changes and trigger a non-watching build:css/postbuild:css. Worked, but was slow
  Piping output to cleanCSS from Stylus without writing to disk first, so cleanCSS can optimise then save. promising, but broke sourcemaps as stylus doesn't create them unless saving the CSS itself
For reference:
`"postbuild:css": "cleancss --source-map build/assets/css/index.css -o build/assets/css/index.min.css",` with `clean-css-cli` installed
