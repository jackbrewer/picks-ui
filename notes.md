Style Guide:

- `import classNames`, not `import classnames`
- `import React, { Children, PropTypes }` as required
- Alphabetical propTypes in destructuring / propType validation
- Alphabetical attributes in JSX
- Directories always singular - `asset`, not `assets`
- Always multiline when multiple attributes in components
- maybe a case for non-multiline attributes when calling simple components?
- Group imports? React, modules, components
- single-line attributes for pasted SVG markup?
- classNames - static, template-string, conditional, props

General

- Trialling ITCSS approach to organising Stylus, using underscored dirnames to reflect triangle depth
